## Image-To-Music
Short and sweet python code converting pixels from an image to "musical data." Arguments accept image and "length" factor, (ratio of pixels analyzed from image, [1, 100] for best results.)

# Example
Take note of "quad.jpg" and "quad.jpg.txt" for an example of the end-product.

# How to use
In terminal, "python (image) (factor)" will create a new .txt file based on the given image. for ~~best~~ functioning results, (image) should be either a .jpg or .png, and (factor) should be a positive integer. 
You can also use "python (image)" which will default (factor) to a reasonable value.

# Warning
This code is rough. Don't be suprised if it doesn't work for "edge cases" and some image files/formats.
